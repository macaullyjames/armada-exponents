# armada-exponents
Solutions from a small programming challenge for an interview with THS Armada.

Challenge description:
> Hello,
>
> As part of the interview, we've prepared a pre-interview programming exercise/question:
> Its quite easy to confirm that 2^6 > 5^2 with a calculator. Confirming that 667687^515964 > 636119^517834 is not as easy, since each number is over a million digits long.
>
> Attached to this email is a .txt file with 1000 pairs of positive numbers, on the form: base,exponent
>
> Which base^exponent pair is the largest?
>
> You can use whatever programming language and libraries you want to solve this. We're currently using Python 3 for our next CRM system, so if you wanted some extra style points, you can use that.
